<h1>What is C++</h1>
 <p>C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports 
    object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
    C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language 
    features.</p>

 <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h3>
<pre>C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object oriented programming used in
     C++ are:
    1. Inheritance
    2. Polymorphism
    3. Encapsulation
    4. Abstraction</pre>

   <h3> Standard Libraries</h3>
<pre> Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:
    o The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
    o The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
    o The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.</pre>
<h3>    Usage of C++</h3>
<pre>    By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and 
    robust applications:
    o Window application
    o Client-Server applicationo Device drivers
    o Embedded firmware etc</pre>
 <h3>   C vs C++</h3>
<table>
 C C++
    1) C follows the procedural 
    style programming.
    C++ is multi-paradigm. It supports 
    both procedural and object oriented.
    2) Data is less secured in C. In C++, you can use modifiers for class 
    members to make it inaccessible for 
    outside users.
    3) C follows the top-down 
    approach.
    C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
    4) C does not support function 
    overloading.
    C++ supports function overloading.
    5) In C, you can't use functions in 
    structure.
    In C++, you can use functions in 
    structure.
    6) C does not support reference 
    variables.
    C++ supports reference variables.
    7) In C, scanf() and 
    printf() are mainly used for 
    input/output.
    C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to 
    perform input and output operations.
    8) Operator overloading is not 
    possible in C.
    Operator overloading is possible in C++.9) C programs are divided 
    into procedures and 
    modules
    C++ programs are divided 
    into functions and classes.
    10) C does not provide the feature 
    of namespace.
    C++ supports the feature of namespace.
    11) Exception handling is not easy 
    in C. It has to perform using 
    other functions.
    C++ provides exception handling using 
    Try and Catch block.

<h3>C++ history</h3>
<pre>History of C++ language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss brief history of C++ language.

    C++ programming language was developed in 1980 by Bjarne Stroustrup at belllaboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), 
    located in U.S.A.
   
    Bjarne Stroustrup is known as the founder of C++ language.
   
    It was develop for adding a feature of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in C without significantly changing the C component.
   
    C++ programming is "relative" (called a superset) of C, it means any valid C program is also a valid C++ program.
    
    Let's see the programming languages that were developed before C++ language.</pre>
    

    Language Year Developed By
    Algol 1960 International Group
    BCPL 1967 Martin Richard
    B 1970 Ken Thompson
    Traditional 
    C
    1972 Dennis Ritchie
    K & R C 1978 Kernighan & Dennis 
    Ritchie
    C++ 1980 Bjarne Stroustrup
<h3>C++ Features</h3>
<pre>C++ is object oriented programming language. It provides a lot of features that are given 
    below.
    1. Simple
    2. Machine Independent or Portable
    3. Mid-level programming language
    4. Structured programming language
    5. Rich Library
    6. Memory Management
    7. Fast Speed
    8. Pointers
    9. Recursion
    10.Extensible
    11.Object Oriented
    12.Compiler based</pre>
<hr>
    
<h4>    1) Simple</h4>
<p>C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.</p>

 <h4>   2) Machine Independent or Portable</h4>
<p>Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.</p>

<h4>    3) Mid-level programming language</h4>
<p>C++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.</p>

<h4>    4) Structured programming language</h4>
<p>C++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.</p>

<h4>    5) Rich Library</h4>
<pre>C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.</pre>

<h4>    6) Memory Management</h4>
<p>It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.</p>

<h4>    7) Speed</h4>
<pre>The compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.</pre>

<h4>    8) Pointer</h4>
<p>C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array etc.</p>

<h4>    9) Recursion</h4>
<pre>In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.</pre>

<h4>    10) Extensible</h4>
<pre>C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.</pre>

<h4>    11) Object Oriented</h4>
<p>C++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.</p>

<h4>    12) Compiler based</h4>
<p>C++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++ program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and then we can execute our program.</p>

<h3>    C++ Installation</h3>
<pre>    There are many compilers available for C++. You need to download any one. Here, we 
    are going to use Turbo C++. It will work for both C and C++. To install the Turbo C++ 
    software, you need to follow following steps.
    1. Download Turbo C++
    2. Create turboc directory inside c drive and extract the tc3.zip inside c:\turboc
    3. Double click on install.exe file
    4. Click on the tc application file located inside c:\TC\BIN to write the c program</pre>
<h4>1) Download Turbo C++ software</h4>
    You can download turbo C++ from many sites. download Turbo c++
<h4>2) Create turboc directory in c drive and extract the tc3.zip</h4>
    Now, you need to create a new directory turboc inside the c: drive. Now extract the 
    tc3.zip file in c:\turboc directory.
<h4>3) Double click on the install.exe file and follow steps</h4>
    Now, click on the install icon located inside the c:\turboc
    It will ask you to install c or not, press enter to install.Change your drive to c, press c.
    Press enter, it will look inside the c:\turboc directory for the required files.Select Start installation by the down arrow key then press enter.
    Now C is installed, press enter to read documentation or close the software.
<h4>4) Click on the tc application located inside c:\TC\BIN</h4>
    Now double click on the tc icon located in c:\TC\BIN directory to write the c program.In windows 7 or window 8, it will show a dialog block to ignore and close the application 
    because full screen mode is not supported. Click on Ignore button.
    Now it will showing following console.
    
    
    
    
    
<h2>    C++ Program</h2>
<pre>Before starting the abcd of C++ language, you need to learn how to write, compile and run the first C++ program.
To write the first C++ program, open the C++ console and write the following code:</pre>
 <pre style="background-color: chartreuse;">        1. #include <iostream.h> 
        2. #include<conio.h> 
        3. void main() { 
        4. clrscr(); 
        5. cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming."; 
        6. getch(); 
        7. } </pre>
<pre>    
    #include<iostream.h> includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading from input
    and writing to output respectively.
   
    #include <conio.h> includes the console input output library functions. The getch() function is defined in conio.h file.
    
    void main() The main() function is the entry point of every program in C++ language. The void keyword specifies that 
    it returns no value.
    
    cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming." is used to print the data "Welcome to C++ Programming." on the console.
    
    getch() The getch() function asks for a single character. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.</pre>
   
   
    <h3>How to compile and run the C++ program</h3>
    There are 2 ways to compile and run the C++ program, by menu and by shortcut.
    By menu
    Now click on the compile menu then compile sub menu to compile the c++ program.
    Then click on the run menu then run sub menu to run the c++ program.
    By shortcut
    Or, press ctrl+f9 keys compile and run the program directly.
    You will see the following output on user screen.You can view the user screen any time by pressing the alt+f5 keys.
    Now press Esc to return to the turbo c++ console.
    C++ Basic Input/Output
    C++ I/O operation is using the stream concept. Stream is the sequence of bytes or flow of 
    data. It makes the performance fast.
    If bytes flow from main memory to device like printer, display screen, or a network 
    connection, etc, this is called as output operation.
    If bytes flow from device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc to main 
    memory, this is called as input operation.
    I/O Library Header Files
    Let us see the common header files used in C++ programming are:
    Header File Function and Description
    <iostream> It is used to define the cout, cin and 
    cerr objects, which correspond to standard 
    output stream, standard input stream and 
    standard error stream, respectively.<iomanip> It is used to declare services useful for 
    performing formatted I/O, such as setprecision 
    and setw.
    <fstream> It is used to declare services for user-controlled 
    file processing.
    Standard output stream (cout)
    The cout is a predefined object of ostream class. It is connected with the standard output 
    device, which is usually a display screen. The cout is used in conjunction with stream 
    insertion operator (<<) to display the output on a console
    Let's see the simple example of standard output stream (cout):
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main( ) { 
    4. char ary[] = "Welcome to C++ tutorial"; 
    5. cout << "Value of ary is: " << ary << endl; 
    6. } 
    Output:
    Value of ary is: Welcome to C++ tutorial
    Standard input stream (cin)
    The cin is a predefined object of istream class. It is connected with the standard input 
    device, which is usually a keyboard. The cin is used in conjunction with stream extraction 
    operator (>>) to read the input from a console.
    Let's see the simple example of standard input stream (cin):
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main( ) { 
    4. int age; 
    5. cout << "Enter your age: "; 6. cin >> age; 
    7. cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl; 
    8. } 
    Output:
    Enter your age: 22
    Your age is: 22
    Standard end line (endl)
    The endl is a predefined object of ostream class. It is used to insert a new line characters 
    and flushes the stream.
    Let's see the simple example of standard end line (endl):
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main( ) { 
    4. cout << "C++ Tutorial"; 
    5. cout << " Javatpoint"<<endl; 
    6. cout << "End of line"<<endl; 
    7. } 
    Output:
    C++ Tutorial Javatpoint 
    End of line
    C++ Variable
    A variable is a name of memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can be changed 
    and it can be reused many times.
    It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified.
    Let's see the syntax to declare a variable:
    1. type variable_list; 
    The example of declaring variable is given below:1. int x; 
    2. float y; 
    3. char z; 
    Here, x, y, z are variables and int, float, char are data types.
    We can also provide values while declaring the variables as given below:
    1. int x=5,b=10; //declaring 2 variable of integer type 
    2. float f=30.8; 
    3. char c='A'; 
    Rules for defining variables
    A variable can have alphabets, digits and underscore.
    A variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It can't start with digit.
    No white space is allowed within variable name.
    A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char, float etc.
    Valid variable names:
    1. int a; 
    2. int _ab; 
    3. int a30; 
    Invalid variable names:
    1. int 4; 
    2. int x y; 
    3. int double; 
    C++ Data Types
    A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, 
    character etc.There are 4 types of data types in C++ language.
    Types Data Types
    Basic Data Type int, char, float, double, etc
    Derived Data Type array, pointer, etc
    Enumeration Data Type enum
    User Defined Data Type structure
    Basic Data Types
    The basic data types are integer-based and floating-point based. C++ language supports 
    both signed and unsigned literals.
    The memory size of basic data types may change according to 32 or 64 bit operating 
    system.
    Let's see the basic data types. It size is given according to 32 bit OS.Data Types Memory Size Range
    char 1 byte -128 to 127
    signed char 1 byte -128 to 127
    unsigned char 1 byte 0 to 127
    short 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    signed short 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    unsigned short 2 byte 0 to 32,767
    int 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    signed int 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    unsigned int 2 byte 0 to 32,767
    short int 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    signed short int 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767
    unsigned short int 2 byte 0 to 32,767
    long int 4 byte
    signed long int 4 byte
    unsigned long int 4 bytefloat 4 byte
    double 8 byte
    long double 10 byte
    C++ Keywords
    A keyword is a reserved word. You cannot use it as a variable name, constant name etc. A 
    list of 32 Keywords in C++ Language which are also available in C language are 
    given below.
    auto break case char const continue default do
    double else enum extern float for goto if
    int long register return short signed sizeof static
    struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while
    A list of 30 Keywords in C++ Language which are not available in C language are 
    given below.
    asm dynamic_cast namespace reinterpret_cast bool
    explicit new static_cast false catch
    operator template friend private class
    this inline public throw const_cast
    delete mutable protected true trytypeid typename using virtual wchar_t
    C++ Operators
    An operator is simply a symbol that is used to perform operations. There can be many types 
    of operations like arithmetic, logical, bitwise etc.
    There are following types of operators to perform different types of operations in C 
    language.
    o Arithmetic Operators
    o Relational Operators
    o Logical Operators
    o Bitwise Operators
    o Assignment Operator
    o Unary operator
    o Ternary or Conditional Operator
    o Misc OperatorPrecedence of Operators in C++
    The precedence of operator species that which operator will be evaluated first and next. The 
    associativity specifies the operators direction to be evaluated, it may be left to right or right 
    to left.
    Let's understand the precedence by the example given below:
    1. int data=5+10*10; 
    The "data" variable will contain 105 because * (multiplicative operator) is evaluated before 
    + (additive operator).
    The precedence and associativity of C++ operators is given below:
    Category Operator Associativity
    Postfix () [] -> . ++ - - Left to right
    Unary + - ! ~ ++ - - (type)* & 
    sizeof
    Right to left
    Multiplicative * / % Left to right
    Additive + - Right to left
    Shift << >> Left to right
    Relational < <= > >= Left to right
    Equality == !=/td> Right to left
    Bitwise AND & Left to right
    Bitwise XOR ^ Left to right
    Bitwise OR | Right to left
    Logical AND && Left to right
    Logical OR || Left to rightConditional ?: Right to left
    Assignment = += -= *= /= %=>>= 
    <<= &= ^= |=
    Right to left
    Comma , Left to right
    C++ if-else
    In C++ programming, if statement is used to test the condition. There are various types of 
    if statements in C++.
    o if statement
    o if-else statement
    o nested if statement
    o if-else-if ladder
    C++ IF Statement
    The C++ if statement tests the condition. It is executed if condition is true.
    1. if(condition){ 
    2. //code to be executed 
    3. } C++ If Example
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. 
    4. int main () { 
    5. int num = 10; 
    6. if (num % 2 == 0) 
    7. { 
    8. cout<<"It is even number"; 
    9. } 
    10. return 0; 
    11.} Output:/p>
    It is even number
    C++ IF-else Statement
    The C++ if-else statement also tests the condition. It executes if block if condition is true 
    otherwise else block is executed.
    1. if(condition){ 
    2. //code if condition is true 
    3. }else{ 
    4. //code if condition is false 
    5. } C++ If-else Example
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main () { 
    4. int num = 11; 
    5. if (num % 2 == 0) 
    6. { 
    7. cout<<"It is even number"; 
    8. } 
    9. else 
    10. { 
    11. cout<<"It is odd number"; 
    12. } 
    13. return 0; 
    14.} 
    Output:
    It is odd number
    C++ If-else Example: with input from user
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main () { 
    4. int num; 
    5. cout<<"Enter a Number: "; 
    6. cin>>num; 
    7. if (num % 2 == 0) 
    8. { 
    9. cout<<"It is even number"<<endl; 
    10. } 
    11. else 
    12. { 
    13. cout<<"It is odd number"<<endl; 
    14. } 15. return 0; 
    16.} 
    Output:
    Enter a number:11
    It is odd number
    Output:
    Enter a number:12
    It is even number
    C++ IF-else-if ladder Statement
    The C++ if-else-if ladder statement executes one condition from multiple statements.
    1. if(condition1){ 
    2. //code to be executed if condition1 is true 
    3. }else if(condition2){ 
    4. //code to be executed if condition2 is true 
    5. } 
    6. else if(condition3){ 
    7. //code to be executed if condition3 is true 
    8. } 
    9. ... 
    10.else{ 
    11. //code to be executed if all the conditions are false 
    12.} C++ If else-if Example
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main () { 
    4. int num; 
    5. cout<<"Enter a number to check grade:"; 
    6. cin>>num; 
    7. if (num <0 || num >100) 
    8. { 
    9. cout<<"wrong number"; 
    10. } 
    11. else if(num >= 0 && num < 50){ 
    12. cout<<"Fail"; 13. } 
    14. else if (num >= 50 && num < 60) 
    15. { 
    16. cout<<"D Grade"; 
    17. } 
    18. else if (num >= 60 && num < 70) 
    19. { 
    20. cout<<"C Grade";

    C++ For Loop
    The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of 
    iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop than while or do-while loops.
    The C++ for loop is same as C/C#. We can initialize variable, check condition and 
    increment/decrement value.
    1. for(initialization; condition; incr/decr){ 
    2. //code to be executed 
    3. }

    C++ Nested For Loop
    In C++, we can use for loop inside another for loop, it is known as nested for loop. The 
    inner loop is executed fully when outer loop is executed one time. So if outer loop and inner 
    loop are executed 4 times, inner loop will be executed 4 times for each outer loop i.e. total 
    16 times.
    C++ Nested For Loop Example
    Let's see a simple example of nested for loop in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3.

    iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop than for loop.
    1. while(condition){ 
    2. //code to be executed 
    3. } 
    Flowchart:C++ While Loop Example
    Let's see a simple example of while loop to print table of 1.

    C++ Do-While Loop
    The C++ do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number 
    of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is 
    recommended to use do-while loop.
    The C++ do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop 
    body.
    1. do{ 
    2. //code to be executed 
    3. }while(condition); 
    Flowchart:C++ do-while Loop Example

    C++ Break Statement
    The C++ break is used to break loop or switch statement. It breaks the current flow of the 
    program at the given condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.
    1. jump-statement; 
    2. break; 
    Flowchart:C++ Break Statement Example

    C++ Goto StatementThe C++ goto statement is also known as jump statement. It is used to transfer control to 
    the other part of the program. It unconditionally jumps to the specified label.
    It can be used to transfer control from deeply nested loop or switch case label.
    C++ Goto Statement Example
    Let's see the simple example of goto statement in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. ineligible: 
    6. cout<<"You are not eligible to vote!\n"; 
    7. cout<<"Enter your age:\n";

    13. else 
    14. { 
    15. cout<<"You are eligible to vote!"; 
    16. } 
    17.} 
    Output:
    You are not eligible to vote!
    Enter your age:
    16
    You are not eligible to vote!
    Enter your age:
    7
    You are not eligible to vote!
    Enter your age:
    22
    You are eligible to vote!C++ Comments
    The C++ comments are statements that are not executed by the compiler. The comments 
    in C++ programming can be used to provide explanation of the code, variable, method or 
    class. By the help of comments, you can hide the program code also.
    There are two types of comments in C++.
    o Single Line comment
    o Multi Line comment
    C++ Single Line Comment
    The single line comment starts with // (double slash). Let's see an example of single line 
    comment in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int x = 11; // x is a variable 
    6. cout<<x<<"\n"; 
    7. } 
    Output:
    11
    C++ Multi Line Comment
    The C++ multi line comment is used to comment multiple lines of code. It is surrounded by 
    slash and asterisk (/∗ ..... ∗/). Let's see an example of multi line comment in C++.
    1. #include <ostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. /* declare and 
    6. print variable in C++. */ 7. int x = 35; 
    8. cout<<x<<"\n"; 
    9. } 
    Output:
    35
    C++ Arrays
    Like other programming languages, array in C++ is a group of similar types of elements 
    that have contiguous memory location.
    In C++ std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays. In C++, array index 
    starts from 0. We can store only fixed set of elements in C++ array.
    Advantages of C++ Array
    o Code Optimization (less code)
    o Random Access
    o Easy to traverse data
    o Easy to manipulate data
    o Easy to sort data etc.
    Disadvantages of C++ Array
    o Fixed sizeC++ Array Types
    There are 2 types of arrays in C++ programming:
    1. Single Dimensional Array
    2. Multidimensional Array
    C++ Single Dimensional Array

    4. { 
    5. int arr[5]={10, 0, 20, 0, 30}; //creating and initializing array 
    6. //traversing array 
    7. for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)

    one.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int arr[5]={10, 0, 20, 0, 30}; //creating and initializing array 
    6. //traversing array 
    7. for (int i: arr)

    C++ Passing Array to Function
    In C++, to reuse the array logic, we can create function. To pass array to function in C++, 
    we need to provide only array name.
    1. functionname(arrayname); //passing array to function

    Maximum element is: 67
    C++ Multidimensional Arrays
    The multidimensional array is also known as rectangular arrays in C++. It can be two 
    dimensional or three dimensional. The data is stored in tabular form (row ∗ column) which is 
    also known as matrix.
    C++ Multidimensional Array Example
    Let's see a simple example of multidimensional array in C++ which declares, initializes and

    C++ Multidimensional Array Example: Declaration and 
    initialization at same time
    Let's see a simple example of multidimensional array which initializes array at the time of 
    declaration.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int test[3][3] = 
    6. { 
    7. {2, 5, 5},

    C++ Pointers
    The pointer in C++ language is a variable, it is also known as locator or indicator that points 
    to an address of a value.
    Advantage of pointer
    1) Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance, it is used to retrieving strings, 
    trees etc. and used with arrays, structures and functions.
    2) We can return multiple values from function using pointer.
    3) It makes you able to access any memory location in the computer's memory.
    Usage of pointer
    There are many usage of pointers in C++ language.
    1) Dynamic memory allocation
    In c language, we can dynamically allocate memory using malloc() and calloc() functions 
    where pointer is used.
    2) Arrays, Functions and Structures
    Pointers in c language are widely used in arrays, functions and structures. It reduces the 
    code and improves the performance.Symbols used in pointer
    Symbol Name Description
    & (ampersand sign) Address operator Determine the address of a variable.
    ∗ (asterisk sign) Indirection operator Access the value of an address.
    Declaring a pointer
    The pointer in C++ language can be declared using ∗ (asterisk symbol).
    1. int ∗ a; //pointer to int 
    2. char ∗ c; //pointer to char 
    Pointer Example
    Let's see the simple example of using pointers printing the address and value.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int number=30; 
    6. int ∗ p; 
    7. p=&number;//stores the address of number variable 
    8. cout<<"Address of number variable is:"<<&number<<endl; 
    9. cout<<"Address of p variable is:"<<p<<endl; 
    10. cout<<"Value of p variable is:"<<*p<<endl; 
    11. return 0; 
    12.} 
    Output
    Address of number variable is:0x7ffccc8724c4
    Address of p variable is:0x7ffccc8724c4
    Value of p variable is:30 Pointer Program to swap 2 numbers without using 3rd 
    variable
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int a=20,b=10,∗p1=&a,∗p2=&b; 
    6. cout<<"Before swap: ∗p1="<<∗p1<<" ∗p2="<<∗p2<<endl; 
    7. ∗p1=∗p1+∗p2; 
    8. ∗p2=∗p1-∗p2; 
    9. ∗p1=∗p1-∗p2; 
    10. cout<<"After swap: ∗p1="<<∗p1<<" ∗p2="<<∗p2<<endl; 
    11. return 0; 
    12.} 
    Output
    Before swap: ∗p1=20 ∗p2=10
    After swap: ∗p1=10 ∗p2=20
    C++ OOPs Concepts
    The major purpose of C++ programming is to introduce the concept of object orientation to 
    the C programming language.
    Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such 
    as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.
    The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as truly 
    object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is considered as the first truly objectoriented programming language.
    OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)
    Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented 
    Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and 
    objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some 
    concepts:o Object
    o Class
    o Inheritance
    o Polymorphism
    o Abstraction
    o Encapsulation
    Object
    Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, 
    table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
    Class
    Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
    Inheritance
    When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. 
    known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime 
    polymorphism.
    Polymorphism
    When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For 
    example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle 
    etc.
    In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.Abstraction
    Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For 
    example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
    In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
    Encapsulation
    Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as 
    encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
    Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented 
    programming language
    1. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented 
    programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.
    2. OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a 
    global data can be accessed from anywhere.
    3. OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can 
    provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented 
    Programming language.
    C++ Object and Class
    Since C++ is an object-oriented language, program is designed using objects and classes in 
    C++.
    C++ Object
    In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.
    In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data and 
    behavior means functionality.
    Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.Object is an instance of a class. All the members of the class can be accessed through 
    object.
    Let's see an example to create object of student class using s1 as the reference variable.
    1. Student s1; //creating an object of Student 
    In this example, Student is the type and s1 is the reference variable that refers to the 
    instance of Student class.
    C++ Class
    In C++, object is a group of similar objects. It is a template from which objects are created. 
    It can have fields, methods, constructors etc.
    Let's see an example of C++ class that has three fields only.
    1. class Student 
    2. { 
    3. public: 
    4. int id; //field or data member 
    5. float salary; //field or data member 
    6. String name;//field or data member 
    7. } 
    C++ Object and Class Example
    Let's see an example of class that has two fields: id and name. It creates instance of the 
    class, initializes the object and prints the object value.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Student { 
    4. public: 
    5. int id;//data member (also instance variable) 
    6. string name;//data member(also instance variable) 
    7. }; 
    8. int main() { 
    9. Student s1; //creating an object of Student 10. s1.id = 201; 
    11. s1.name = "Sonoo Jaiswal"; 
    12. cout<<s1.id<<endl; 
    13. cout<<s1.name<<endl; 
    14. return 0; 
    15.} 
    Output:
    201
    Sonoo Jaiswal
    C++ Class Example: Initialize and Display data through 
    method
    Let's see another example of C++ class where we are initializing and displaying object 
    through method.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Student { 
    4. public: 
    5. int id;//data member (also instance variable) 
    6. string name;//data member(also instance variable) 
    7. void insert(int i, string n) 
    8. { 
    9. id = i; 
    10. name = n; 
    11. } 
    12. void display() 
    13. { 
    14. cout<<id<<" "<<name<<endl; 
    15. } 
    16.}; 
    17.int main(void) { 
    18. Student s1; //creating an object of Student 
    19. Student s2; //creating an object of Student 
    20. s1.insert(201, "Sonoo"); 21. s2.insert(202, "Nakul"); 
    22. s1.display(); 
    23. s2.display(); 
    24. return 0; 
    25.} 
    Output:
    201 Sonoo
    202 Nakul
    C++ Class Example: Store and Display Employee 
    Information
    Let's see another example of C++ class where we are storing and displaying employee 
    information using method.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Employee { 
    4. public: 
    5. int id;//data member (also instance variable) 
    6. string name;//data member(also instance variable) 
    7. float salary; 
    8. void insert(int i, string n, float s) 
    9. { 
    10. id = i; 
    11. name = n; 
    12. salary = s; 
    13. } 
    14. void display() 
    15. { 
    16. cout<<id<<" "<<name<<" "<<salary<<endl; 
    17. } 
    18.}; 
    19.int main(void) { 
    20. Employee e1; //creating an object of Employee 
    21. Employee e2; //creating an object of Employee 22. e1.insert(201, "Sonoo",990000); 
    23. e2.insert(202, "Nakul", 29000); 
    24. e1.display(); 
    25. e2.display(); 
    26. return 0; 
    27.} 
    Output:
    201 Sonoo 990000
    202 Nakul 29000
    C++ Constructor
    In C++, constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object 
    creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new object generally. The constructor 
    in C++ has the same name as class or structure.
    There can be two types of constructors in C++.
    o Default constructor
    o Parameterized constructor
    C++ Default Constructor
    A constructor which has no argument is known as default constructor. It is invoked at the 
    time of creating object.
    Let's see the simple example of C++ default Constructor.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Employee 
    4. { 
    5. public: 
    6. Employee() 
    7. { 
    8. cout<<"Default Constructor Invoked"<<endl; 
    9. } 
    10.}; 11.int main(void) 
    12.{ 
    13. Employee e1; //creating an object of Employee 
    14. Employee e2; 
    15. return 0; 
    16.} 
    Output:
    Default Constructor Invoked 
    Default Constructor Invoked
    C++ Parameterized Constructor
    A constructor which has parameters is called parameterized constructor. It is used to 
    provide different values to distinct objects.
    Let's see the simple example of C++ Parameterized Constructor.
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Employee {
     public:
     int id;//data member (also instance variable) 
     string name;//data member(also instance variable)
     float salary;
     Employee(int i, string n, float s) 
     { 
     id = i; 
     name = n; 
     salary = s;
     } 
     void display() 
     { 
     cout<<id<<" "<<name<<" "<<salary<<endl; 
     } 
    };
    int main(void) {
     Employee e1 =Employee(101, "Sonoo", 890000); //creating an object of 
    Employee 
     Employee e2=Employee(102, "Nakul", 59000); 
     e1.display(); 
     e2.display(); 
     return 0;
    }
    Output:
    101 Sonoo 890000102 Nakul 59000
    C++ Destructor
    A destructor works opposite to constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be 
    defined only once in a class. Like constructors, it is invoked automatically.
    A destructor is defined like constructor. It must have same name as class. But it is prefixed 
    with a tilde sign (~).
    Note: C++ destructor cannot have parameters. Moreover, modifiers can't be applied on destructors.
    C++ Constructor and Destructor Example
    Let's see an example of constructor and destructor in C++ which is called automatically.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Employee 
    4. { 
    5. public: 
    6. Employee() 
    7. { 
    8. cout<<"Constructor Invoked"<<endl; 
    9. } 
    10. ~Employee() 
    11. { 
    12. cout<<"Destructor Invoked"<<endl; 
    13. } 
    14.}; 
    15.int main(void) 
    16.{ 
    17. Employee e1; //creating an object of Employee 
    18. Employee e2; //creating an object of Employee 
    19. return 0; 
    20.} 
    Output:
    Constructor InvokedConstructor Invoked
    Destructor Invoked
    Destructor Invoked
    C++ this Pointer
    In C++ programming, this is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class. 
    There can be 3 main usage of this keyword in C++.
    o It can be used to pass current object as a parameter to another method.
    o It can be used to refer current class instance variable.
    o It can be used to declare indexers.
    C++ this Pointer Example
    Let's see the example of this keyword in C++ that refers to the fields of current class.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Employee { 
    4. public: 
    5. int id; //data member (also instance variable) 
    6. string name; //data member(also instance variable) 
    7. float salary; 
    8. Employee(int id, string name, float salary) 
    9. { 
    10. this->id = id; 
    11. this->name = name; 
    12. this->salary = salary; 
    13. } 
    14. void display() 
    15. { 
    16. cout<<id<<" "<<name<<" "<<salary<<endl; 
    17. } 
    18.}; 
    19.int main(void) { 
    20. Employee e1 =Employee(101, "Sonoo", 890000); //creating an object of Employee 
    21. Employee e2=Employee(102, "Nakul", 59000); //creating an object of Employee 22. e1.display(); 
    23. e2.display(); 
    24. return 0; 
    25.} 
    Output:
    101 Sonoo 890000
    102 Nakul 59000
    C++ Structs
    In C++, classes and structs are blueprints that are used to create instance of a class. 
    Structs are used for lightweight objects such as Rectangle, color, Point etc.
    Unlike class, structs in C++ are value type than reference type. It is useful if you have data 
    that is not intended to be modified after creation of struct.
    C++ Struct Example
    Let's see a simple example of struct Rectangle which has two data members width and 
    height.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. struct Rectangle 
    4. { 
    5. int width, height; 
    6. 
    7. }; 
    8. int main(void) { 
    9. struct Rectangle rec; 
    10. rec.width=8; 
    11. rec.height=5; 
    12. cout<<"Area of Rectangle is: "<<(rec.width * rec.height)<<endl; 
    13. return 0; 
    14.} 
    Output:
    Area of Rectangle is: 40C++ Struct Example: Using Constructor and Method
    Let's see another example of struct where we are using constructor to initialize data and 
    method to calculate area of rectangle.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. struct Rectangle 
    4. { 
    5. int width, height; 
    6. Rectangle(int w, int h) 
    7. { 
    8. width = w; 
    9. height = h; 
    10. } 
    11. void areaOfRectangle() { 
    12. cout<<"Area of Rectangle is: "<<(width*height); } 
    13. }; 
    14.int main(void) { 
    15. struct Rectangle rec=Rectangle(4,6); 
    16. rec.areaOfRectangle(); 
    17. return 0; 
    18.} 
    Output:
    Area of Rectangle is: 24
    C++ Enumeration
    Enum in C++ is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
    It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, 
    THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY) , directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST) etc. 
    The C++ enum constants are static and final implicitly.
    C++ Enums can be thought of as classes that have fixed set of constants.Points to remember for C++ Enum
    o enum improves type safety
    o enum can be easily used in switch
    o enum can be traversed
    o enum can have fields, constructors and methods
    o enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it 
    internally extends Enum class
    C++ Enumeration Example
    Let's see the simple example of enum data type used in C++ program.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. enum week { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday }; 
    4. int main() 
    5. { 
    6. week day; 
    7. day = Friday; 
    8. cout << "Day: " << day+1<<endl; 
    9. return 0; 
    10.} 
    Output:
    Day: 5
    C++ friend function
    If a function is defined as a friend function in C++ then the protected and private data of a 
    class can be accessed using the function.
    By using the keyword friend compiler knows the given function is a friend function.
    For accessing the data, the declaration of a friend function should be done inside the body 
    of a class starting with the keyword friend.Declaration of friend function in C++
    1. class class_name 
    2. { 
    3. friend data_type function_name(argument/s); 
    4. }; 
    C++ friend function Example
    Let's see the simple example of C++ friend function used to print the length of a box.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Box 
    4. { 
    5. private: 
    6. int length; 
    7. public: 
    8. Box(): length(0) { } 
    9. friend int printLength(Box); //friend function 
    10.}; 
    11.int printLength(Box b) 
    12.{ 
    13. b.length += 10; 
    14. return b.length; 
    15.} 
    16.int main() 
    17.{ 
    18. Box b; 
    19. cout<<"Length of box: "<< printLength(b)<<endl; 
    20. return 0; 
    21.} 
    Output:
    Length of box: 10 
    C++ InheritanceIn C++, inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and 
    behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify 
    the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.
    In C++, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and 
    the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the 
    specialized class for the base class.
    Advantage of C++ Inheritance
    Code reusability: Now you can reuse the members of your parent class. So, there is no 
    need to define the member again. So less code is required in the class.
    C++ Single Level Inheritance Example: Inheriting Fields
    When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance. Let's see the 
    example of single level inheritance which inherits the fields only.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Account { 
    4. public: 
    5. float salary = 60000; 
    6. }; 
    7. class Programmer: public Account { 
    8. public: 
    9. float bonus = 5000; 
    10. }; 
    11.int main(void) { 
    12. Programmer p1; 
    13. cout<<"Salary: "<<p1.salary<<endl; 
    14. cout<<"Bonus: "<<p1.bonus<<endl; 
    15. return 0; 
    16.} 
    Output:
    Salary: 60000
    Bonus: 5000
    In the above example, Employee is the base class and Programmer is the derived class.C++ Single Level Inheritance Example: Inheriting 
    Methods
    Let's see another example of inheritance in C++ which inherits methods only.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Animal { 
    4. public: 
    5. void eat() { 
    6. cout<<"Eating..."<<endl; 
    7. } 
    8. }; 
    9. class Dog: public Animal 
    10. { 
    11. public: 
    12. void bark(){ 
    13. cout<<"Barking..."; 
    14. } 
    15. }; 
    16.int main(void) { 
    17. Dog d1; 
    18. d1.eat(); 
    19. d1.bark(); 
    20. return 0; 
    21.} 
    Output:
    Eating...
    Barking...
    C++ Multi Level Inheritance Example
    When one class inherits another class which is further inherited by another class, it is known 
    as multi level inheritance in C++. Inheritance is transitive so the last derived class acquires 
    all the members of all its base classes.
    Let's see the example of multi level inheritance in C++.1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Animal { 
    4. public: 
    5. void eat() { 
    6. cout<<"Eating..."<<endl; 
    7. } 
    8. }; 
    9. class Dog: public Animal 
    10. { 
    11. public: 
    12. void bark(){ 
    13. cout<<"Barking..."<<endl; 
    14. } 
    15. }; 
    16. class BabyDog: public Dog 
    17. { 
    18. public: 
    19. void weep() { 
    20. cout<<"Weeping..."; 
    21. } 
    22. }; 
    23.int main(void) { 
    24. BabyDog d1; 
    25. d1.eat(); 
    26. d1.bark(); 
    27. d1.weep(); 
    28. return 0; 
    29.} 
    Output:
    Eating...
    Barking?
    Weeping?
    C++ Aggregation (HAS-A Relationship)In C++, aggregation is a process in which one class defines another class as any entity 
    reference. It is another way to reuse the class. It is a form of association that represents 
    HAS-A relationship.
    C++ Aggregation Example
    Let's see an example of aggregation where Employee class has the reference of Address 
    class as data member. In such way, it can reuse the members of Address class.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Address { 
    4. public: 
    5. string addressLine, city, state; 
    6. Address(string addressLine, string city, string state) 
    7. { 
    8. this->addressLine = addressLine; 
    9. this->city = city; 
    10. this->state = state; 
    11. } 
    12.}; 
    13. class Employee 
    14. { 
    15. private: 
    16. Address* address; //Employee HAS-A Address 
    17. public: 
    18. int id; 
    19. string name; 
    20. Employee(int id, string name, Address* address) 
    21. { 
    22. this->id = id; 
    23. this->name = name; 
    24. this->address = address; 
    25. } 
    26. void display() 
    27. { 
    28. cout<<id <<" "<<name<< " "<< 29. address->addressLine<< " "<< address->city<< " "<<address->state<<endl; 
    30. } 
    31. }; 
    32.int main(void) { 
    33. Address a1= Address("C-146, Sec-15","Noida","UP"); 
    34. Employee e1 = Employee(101,"Nakul",&a1); 
    35. e1.display(); 
    36. return 0; 
    37.} 
    Output:
    101 Nakul C-146, Sec-15 Noida UP
    C++ Polymorphism
    The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many 
    forms. It is a greek word. In object-oriented programming, we use 3 main concepts: 
    inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
    There are two types of polymorphism in C++:
    o Compile time polymorphism: It is achieved by function overloading and operator 
    overloading which is also known as static binding or early binding.
    o Runtime polymorphism: It is achieved by method overriding which is also known 
    as dynamic binding or late binding.
    C++ Runtime Polymorphism Example
    Let's see a simple example of runtime polymorphism in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Animal { 
    4. public: 
    5. void eat(){ 
    6. cout<<"Eating..."; 
    7. } 
    8. }; 9. class Dog: public Animal 
    10.{ 
    11. public: 
    12. void eat() 
    13. { 
    14. cout<<"Eating bread..."; 
    15. } 
    16.}; 
    17.int main(void) { 
    18. Dog d = Dog(); 
    19. d.eat(); 
    20. return 0; 
    21.} 
    Output:
    Eating bread...
    C++ Runtime Polymorphism Example: By using two 
    derived class
    Let's see another example of runtime polymorphism in C++ where we are having two 
    derived classes.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Shape { 
    4. public: 
    5. virtual void draw(){ 
    6. cout<<"drawing..."<<endl; 
    7. } 
    8. }; 
    9. class Rectangle: public Shape 
    10.{ 
    11. public: 
    12. void draw() 
    13. { 
    14. cout<<"drawing rectangle..."<<endl; 15. } 
    16.}; 
    17. class Circle: public Shape 
    18.{ 
    19. public: 
    20. void draw() 
    21. { 
    22. cout<<"drawing circle..."<<endl; 
    23. } 
    24.}; 
    25.int main(void) { 
    26. Shape *s; 
    27. Shape sh; 
    28. Rectangle rec; 
    29. Circle cir; 
    30. s=&sh; 
    31. s->draw(); 
    32. s=&rec; 
    33. s->draw(); 
    34. s=○ 
    35. s->draw(); 
    36.} 
    Output:
    drawing...
    drawing rectangle...
    drawing circle...
    Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members
    Runtime Polymorphism can be achieved by data members in C++. Let's see an example 
    where we are accessing the field by reference variable which refers to the instance of 
    derived class.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Animal { 
    4. public: 
    5. string color = "Black"; 6. }; 
    7. class Dog: public Animal 
    8. { 
    9. public: 
    10. string color = "Grey"; 
    11.}; 
    12.int main(void) { 
    13. Animal d= Dog(); 
    14. cout<<d.color; 
    15.} 
    Output:
    Black
    C++ Overloading (Function and Operator)
    If we create two or more members having same name but different in number or type of 
    parameter, it is known as C++ overloading. In C++, we can overload:
    o methods,
    o constructors, and
    o indexed properties
    It is because these members have parameters only.
    Types of overloading in C++ are:
    o Function overloading
    o Operators overloading
    C++ Function Overloading
    Having two or more function with same name but different in parameters, is known as 
    function overloading in C++.
    The advantage of Function overloading is that it increases the readability of the program 
    because you don't need to use different names for same action.C++ Function Overloading Example
    Let's see the simple example of function overloading where we are changing number of 
    arguments of add() method.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Cal { 
    4. public: 
    5. static int add(int a,int b){ 
    6. return a + b; 
    7. } 
    8. static int add(int a, int b, int c) 
    9. { 
    10. return a + b + c; 
    11. } 
    12.}; 
    13.int main(void) { 
    14. Cal C; 
    15. cout<<C.add(10, 20)<<endl; 
    16. cout<<C.add(12, 20, 23); 
    17. return 0; 
    18.} 
    Output:
    30
    55
    C++ Operators Overloading
    Operator overloading is used to overload or redefine most of the operators available in C++. 
    It is used to perform operation on user define data type.
    The advantage of Operators overloading is to perform different operations on the same 
    operand.
    C++ Operators Overloading Example
    Let's see the simple example of operator overloading in C++. In this example, void operator 
    ++ () operator function is defined (inside Test class).1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Test 
    4. { 
    5. private: 
    6. int num; 
    7. public: 
    8. Test(): num(8){} 
    9. void operator ++() 
    10. { 
    11. num = num+2; 
    12. } 
    13. void Print() { 
    14. cout<<"The Count is: "<<num; 
    15. } 
    16.}; 
    17.int main() 
    18.{ 
    19. Test tt; 
    20. ++tt; // calling of a function "void operator ++()" 
    21. tt.Print(); 
    22. return 0; 
    23.} 
    Output:
    The Count is: 10
    C++ virtual function
    C++ virtual function is a member function in base class that you redefine in a derived class. 
    It is declare using the virtual keyword.
    It is used to tell the compiler to perform dynamic linkage or late binding on the function.
    Late binding or Dynamic linkage
    In late binding function call is resolved during runtime. Therefore compiler determines the 
    type of object at runtime, and then binds the function call.C++ virtual function Example
    Let's see the simple example of C++ virtual function used to invoked the derived class in a 
    program.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class A 
    4. { 
    5. public: 
    6. virtual void display() 
    7. { 
    8. cout << "Base class is invoked"<<endl; 
    9. } 
    10.}; 
    11. class B:public A 
    12.{ 
    13. public: 
    14. void display() 
    15. { 
    16. cout << "Derived Class is invoked"<<endl; 
    17. } 
    18.}; 
    19.int main() 
    20.{ 
    21. A* a; //pointer of base class 
    22. B b; //object of derived class 
    23. a = &b; 
    24. a->display(); //Late Binding occurs 
    25.} 
    Output:
    Derived Class is invoked 
    Interfaces in C++ (Abstract Classes)Abstract classes are the way to achieve abstraction in C++. Abstraction in C++ is the 
    process to hide the internal details and showing functionality only. Abstraction can be 
    achieved by two ways:
    1. Abstract class
    2. Interface
    Abstract class and interface both can have abstract methods which are necessary for 
    abstraction.
    C++ Abstract class
    In C++ class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as <>strong>pure 
    virtual function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration. Its 
    implementation must be provided by derived classes.
    Let's see an example of abstract class in C++ which has one abstract method draw(). Its 
    implementation is provided by derived classes: Rectangle and Circle. Both classes have 
    different implementation.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Shape 
    4. { 
    5. public: 
    6. virtual void draw()=0; 
    7. }; 
    8. class Rectangle : Shape 
    9. { 
    10. public: 
    11. void draw() 
    12. { 
    13. cout < <"drawing rectangle..." < <endl; 
    14. } 
    15.}; 
    16. class Circle : Shape 
    17.{ 
    18. public:
    19. void draw() 20. { 
    21. cout <<"drawing circle..." < <endl; 
    22. } 
    23.}; 
    24.int main( ) { 
    25. Rectangle rec; 
    26. Circle cir; 
    27. rec.draw(); 
    28. cir.draw(); 
    29. return 0; 
    30.} 
    Output:
    drawing rectangle...
    drawing circle...
    Data Abstraction in C++
    In C++ program if we implement class with private and public members then it is an 
    example of data abstraction.
    Let's see the simple example of data abstraction.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. class Sum 
    4. { 
    5. private: int x, y, z; 
    6. public: 
    7. void add() 
    8. { 
    9. cout<<"Enter two numbers: "; 
    10. cin>>x>>y; 
    11. z= x+y; 
    12. cout<<"Sum of two number is: "<<z<<endl; 
    13.} 
    14.}; 
    15.int main() 
    16.{ 17.Sum sm; 
    18. sm.add(); 
    19. return 0; 
    20.} 
    Output:
    Enter two numbers:
    3
    6
    Sum of two number is: 9
    C++ Namespaces
    Namespaces in C++ are used to organize too many classes so that it can be easy to handle 
    the application.
    For accessing the class of a namespace, we need to use namespacename::classname. We 
    can use using keyword so that we don't have to use complete name all the time.
    In C++, global namespace is the root namespace. The global::std will always refer to the 
    namespace "std" of C++ Framework.
    C++ namespace Example
    Let's see the simple example of namespace which include variable and functions.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. namespace First { 
    4. void sayHello() { 
    5. cout<<"Hello First Namespace"<<endl; 
    6. } 
    7. } 
    8. namespace Second { 
    9. void sayHello() { 
    10. cout<<"Hello Second Namespace"<<endl; 
    11. } 
    12.} 
    13.int main() 
    14.{ 15. First::sayHello(); 
    16. Second::sayHello(); 
    17. return 0; 
    18.} 
    Output:
    Hello First Namespace
    Hello Second Namespace
    C++ namespace example: by using keyword
    Let's see another example of namespace where we are using "using" keyword so that we 
    don't have to use complete name for accessing a namespace program.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. namespace First{ 
    4. void sayHello(){ 
    5. cout << "Hello First Namespace" << endl; 
    6. } 
    7. } 
    8. namespace Second{ 
    9. void sayHello(){ 
    10. cout << "Hello Second Namespace" << endl; 
    11. } 
    12.} 
    13. using namespace First; 
    14.int main () { 
    15. sayHello(); 
    16. return 0; 
    17.} 
    Output:
    Hello First Namespace

    9. } 
    Output:

    It returns the allocated object associated 
    with the string.
    C++ Exception Handling
    Exception Handling in C++ is a process to handle runtime errors. We perform exception 
    handling so the normal flow of the application can be maintained even after runtime errors.
    In C++, exception is an event or object which is thrown at runtime. All exceptions are 
    derived from std::exception class. It is a runtime error which can be handled. If we don't 
    handle the exception, it prints exception message and terminates the program.
    Advantage
    It maintains the normal flow of the application. In such case, rest of the code is executed 
    even after exception.C++ Exception Classes
    In C++ standard exceptions are defined in <exception> class that we can use inside our 
    programs. The arrangement of parent-child class hierarchy is shown below:
    All the exception classes in C++ are derived from std::exception class. Let's see the list of 
    C++ common exception classes.
    Exception Description
    std::exception It is an exception and parent 
    class of all standard C++ 
    exceptions.std::logic_failure It is an exception that can be 
    detected by reading a code.
    std::runtime_error It is an exception that cannot 
    be detected by reading a code.
    std::bad_exception It is used to handle the 
    unexpected exceptions in a
    c++ program.
    std::bad_cast This exception is generally be 
    thrown by dynamic_cast.
    std::bad_typeid This exception is generally be 
    thrown by typeid.
    std::bad_alloc This exception is generally be 
    thrown by new.
    C++ Exception Handling Keywords
    In C++, we use 3 keywords to perform exception handling:
    o try
    o catch, and
    o throw
    Moreover, we can create user-defined exception which we will learn in next chapters.
    C++ try/catch
    In C++ programming, exception handling is performed using try/catch statement. The 
    C++ try block is used to place the code that may occur exception. The catch block is used 
    to handle the exception.
    C++ example without try/catch1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. float division(int x, int y) { 
    4. return (x/y); 
    5. } 
    6. int main () { 
    7. int i = 50; 
    8. int j = 0; 
    9. float k = 0; 
    10. k = division(i, j); 
    11. cout << k << endl; 
    12. return 0; 
    13.} 
    Output:
    Floating point exception (core dumped) 
    C++ try/catch example
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. float division(int x, int y) { 
    4. if( y == 0 ) { 
    5. throw "Attempted to divide by zero!"; 
    6. } 
    7. return (x/y); 
    8. } 
    9. int main () { 
    10. int i = 25; 
    11. int j = 0; 
    12. float k = 0; 
    13. try { 
    14. k = division(i, j); 
    15. cout << k << endl; 
    16. }catch (const char* e) { 
    17. cerr << e << endl; 18. } 
    19. return 0; 
    20.} 
    Output:
    Attempted to divide by zero!
    C++ User-Defined Exceptions
    The new exception can be defined by overriding and inheriting exception class 
    functionality.
    C++ user-defined exception example
    Let's see the simple example of user-defined exception in which std::exception class is 
    used to define the exception.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. #include <exception> 
    3. using namespace std; 
    4. class MyException : public exception{ 
    5. public: 
    6. const char * what() const throw() 
    7. { 
    8. return "Attempted to divide by zero!\n"; 
    9. } 
    10.}; 
    11.int main() 
    12.{ 
    13. try 
    14. { 
    15. int x, y; 
    16. cout << "Enter the two numbers : \n"; 
    17. cin >> x >> y; 
    18. if (y == 0) 
    19. { 
    20. MyException z; 
    21. throw z; 
    22. } 23. else 
    24. { 
    25. cout << "x / y = " << x/y << endl; 
    26. } 
    27. } 
    28. catch(exception& e) 
    29. { 
    30. cout << e.what(); 
    31. } 
    32.} 
    Output:
    Enter the two numbers :
    10
    2
    x / y = 5 
    Output:
    Enter the two numbers :
    10
    0
    Attempted to divide by zero!
    -->
    Note: In above example what() is a public method provided by the exception class. It is 
    used to return the cause of an exception.
    C++ Files and Streams
    In C++ programming we are using the iostream standard library, it 
    provides cin and cout methods for reading from input and writing to output respectively.
    To read and write from a file we are using the standard C++ library called fstream. Let us 
    see the data types define in fstream library is:
    Data Type Description
    fstream It is used to create files, write 
    information to files, and read 
    information from files.ifstream It is used to read information 
    from files.
    ofstream It is used to create files and 
    write information to the files.
    C++ FileStream example: writing to a file
    Let's see the simple example of writing to a text file testout.txt using C++ FileStream 
    programming.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. #include <fstream> 
    3. using namespace std; 
    4. int main () { 
    5. ofstream filestream("testout.txt"); 
    6. if (filestream.is_open()) 
    7. { 
    8. filestream << "Welcome to javaTpoint.\n"; 
    9. filestream << "C++ Tutorial.\n"; 
    10. filestream.close(); 
    11. } 
    12. else cout <<"File opening is fail."; 
    13. return 0; 
    14.} 
    Output:
    The content of a text file testout.txt is set with the data:
    Welcome to javaTpoint.
    C++ Tutorial.
    C++ FileStream example: reading from a file
    Let's see the simple example of reading from a text file testout.txt using C++ FileStream 
    programming.
    1. #include <iostream> 2. #include <fstream> 
    3. using namespace std; 
    4. int main () { 
    5. string srg; 
    6. ifstream filestream("testout.txt"); 
    7. if (filestream.is_open()) 
    8. { 
    9. while ( getline (filestream,srg) ) 
    10. { 
    11. cout << srg <<endl; 
    12. } 
    13. filestream.close(); 
    14. } 
    15. else { 
    16. cout << "File opening is fail."<<endl; 
    17. } 
    18. return 0; 
    19.} 
    Note: Before running the code a text file named as "testout.txt" is need to be created and 
    the content of a text file is given below:
    Welcome to javaTpoint.
    C++ Tutorial.
    Output:
    Welcome to javaTpoint.
    C++ Tutorial.
    C++ Read and Write Example
    Let's see the simple example of writing the data to a text file testout.txt and then reading 
    the data from the file using C++ FileStream programming.
    1. #include <fstream> 
    2. #include <iostream> 
    3. using namespace std; 
    4. int main () { 5. char input[75]; 
    6. ofstream os; 
    7. os.open("testout.txt"); 
    8. cout <<"Writing to a text file:" << endl; 
    9. cout << "Please Enter your name: "; 
    10. cin.getline(input, 100); 
    11. os << input << endl; 
    12. cout << "Please Enter your age: "; 
    13. cin >> input; 
    14. cin.ignore(); 
    15. os << input << endl; 
    16. os.close(); 
    17. ifstream is; 
    18. string line; 
    19. is.open("testout.txt"); 
    20. cout << "Reading from a text file:" << endl; 
    21. while (getline (is,line)) 
    22. { 
    23. cout << line << endl; 
    24. } 
    25. is.close(); 
    26. return 0; 
    27.} 
    Output:
    Writing to a text file:

    series are 0 and 1.
    There are two ways to write the fibonacci series program:o Fibonacci Series without recursion
    o Fibonacci Series using recursion
    Fibonaccci Series in C++ without Recursion
    Let's see the fibonacci series program in C++ without recursion.

    Prime Number Program in C++
    Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself. In other words, 
    prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1. For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    11, 13, 17, 19, 23.... are the prime numbers.
    Let's see the prime number program in C++. In this C++ program, we will take an input 
    from the user and check whether the number is prime or not.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int n, i, m=0, flag=0; 
    6. cout << "Enter the Number to check Prime: "; 
    7. cin >> n; 
    8. m=n/2; 
    9. for(i = 2; i <= m; i++) 
    10. { 11. if(n % i == 0) 
    12. { 
    13. cout<<"Number is not Prime."<<endl; 
    14. flag=1; 
    15. break; 
    16. } 
    17. } 
    18. if (flag==0) 
    19. cout << "Number is Prime."<<endl; 
    20. return 0; 
    21.} 
    Output:
    Enter the Number to check Prime: 17 
    Number is Prime. 
    Enter the Number to check Prime: 57 
    Number is not Prime.
    Palindrome program in C++
    A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 121, 34543, 
    343, 131, 48984 are the palindrome numbers.
    Palindrome number algorithm
    o Get the number from user
    o Hold the number in temporary variable
    o Reverse the number
    o Compare the temporary number with reversed number
    o If both numbers are same, print palindrome number
    o Else print not palindrome number
    Let's see the palindrome program in C++. In this program, we will get an input from the 
    user and check whether number is palindrome or not.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 5. int n,r,sum=0,temp; 
    6. cout<<"Enter the Number="; 
    7. cin>>n; 
    8. temp=n; 
    9. while(n>0) 
    10.{ 
    11. r=n%10; 
    12. sum=(sum*10)+r; 
    13. n=n/10; 
    14.} 
    15.if(temp==sum) 
    16. cout<<"Number is Palindrome."; 
    17.else 
    18. cout<<"Number is not Palindrome."; 
    19. return 0; 
    20.} 
    Output:
    Enter the Number=121 
    Number is Palindrome.
    Enter the number=113 
    Number is not Palindrome.
    Factorial program in C++
    Factorial Program in C++: Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. 
    Factorial of n is denoted by n!. For example:
    1. 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24 
    2. 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 
    Here, 4! is pronounced as "4 factorial", it is also called "4 bang" or "4 shriek".
    The factorial is normally used in Combinations and Permutations (mathematics).
    There are many ways to write the factorial program in C++ language. Let's see the 2 ways 
    to write the factorial program.
    o Factorial Program using loop
    o Factorial Program using recursionFactorial Program using Loop
    Let's see the factorial Program in C++ using loop.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int i,fact=1,number; 
    6. cout<<"Enter any Number: "; 
    7. cin>>number; 
    8. for(i=1;i<=number;i++){ 
    9. fact=fact*i; 
    10. } 
    11. cout<<"Factorial of " <<number<<" is: "<<fact<<endl; 
    12. return 0; 
    13.} 
    Output:
    Enter any Number: 5 
    Factorial of 5 is: 120 
    Factorial Program using Recursion
    Let's see the factorial program in C++ using recursion.
    1. #include<iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int factorial(int); 
    6. int fact,value; 
    7. cout<<"Enter any number: "; 
    8. cin>>value; 
    9. fact=factorial(value); 
    10. cout<<"Factorial of a number is: "<<fact<<endl; 
    11. return 0; 
    12.} 13.int factorial(int n) 
    14.{ 
    15.if(n<0) 
    16. return(-1); /*Wrong value*/ 
    17.if(n==0) 
    18. return(1); /*Terminating condition*/ 
    19.else 
    20.{ 
    21. return(n*factorial(n-1)); 
    22.} 
    23.} 
    Output:
    Enter any number: 6 
    Factorial of a number is: 720
    Armstrong Number in C++
    Before going to write the C++ program to check whether the number is Armstrong or not, 
    let's understand what is Armstrong number.
    Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 
    0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.
    Let's try to understand why 371 is an Armstrong number.
    1. 371 = (3*3*3)+(7*7*7)+(1*1*1) 
    2. where: 
    3. (3*3*3)=27 
    4. (7*7*7)=343 
    5. (1*1*1)=1 
    6. So: 
    7. 27+343+1=371 
    Let's see the C++ program to check Armstrong Number.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int n,r,sum=0,temp; 6. cout<<"Enter the Number= "; 
    7. cin>>n; 
    8. temp=n; 
    9. while(n>0) 
    10.{ 
    11. r=n%10; 
    12. sum=sum+(r*r*r); 
    13.n=n/10; 
    14.} 
    15.if(temp==sum) 
    16. cout<<"Armstrong Number."<<endl; 
    17.else 
    18. cout<<"Not Armstrong Number."<<endl; 
    19. return 0; 
    20.} 
    Output:
    Enter the Number= 371
    Armstrong Number.
    Enter the Number= 342 
    Not Armstrong Number.
    Sum of digits program in C++
    We can write the sum of digits program in C++ language by the help of loop and 
    mathematical operation only.
    Sum of digits algorithm
    To get sum of each digit by C++ program, use the following algorithm:
    o Step 1: Get number by user
    o Step 2: Get the modulus/remainder of the number
    o Step 3: sum the remainder of the number
    o Step 4: Divide the number by 10
    o Step 5: Repeat the step 2 while number is greater than 0.
    Let's see the sum of digits program in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int n,sum=0,m; 
    6. cout<<"Enter a number: "; 
    7. cin>>n; 
    8. while(n>0) 
    9. { 
    10.m=n%10; 
    11. sum=sum+m;

    C++ Program to reverse number
    We can reverse a number in C++ using loop and arithmetic operators. In this program, we 
    are getting number as input from the user and reversing that number.
    Let's see a simple C++ example to reverse a given number.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int n, reverse=0, rem; 
    6. cout<<"Enter a number: "; 
    7. cin>>n; 
    8. while(n!=0) 
    9. { 
    10. rem=n%10; 
    11. reverse=reverse*10+rem; 12. n/=10; 
    13. } 
    14. cout<<"Reversed Number: "<<reverse<<endl; 
    15. return 0; 
    16.} 
    Output:
    Enter a number: 234 
    Reversed Number: 432
    C++ Program to swap two numbers without 
    third variable
    We can swap two numbers without using third variable. There are two common ways to 
    swap two numbers without using third variable:
    1. By + and -
    2. By * and /
    Program 1: Using * and /
    Let's see a simple C++ example to swap two numbers without using third variable.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int a=5, b=10; 
    6. cout<<"Before swap a= "<<a<<" b= "<<b<<endl; 
    7. a=a*b; //a=50 (5*10) 
    8. b=a/b; //b=5 (50/10) 
    9. a=a/b; //a=10 (50/5) 
    10. cout<<"After swap a= "<<a<<" b= "<<b<<endl; 
    11. return 0; 
    12.} 
    Output:
    Before swap a= 5 b= 10 
    After swap a= 10 b= 5Program 2: Using + and -
    Let's see another example to swap two numbers using + and -.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int a=5, b=10; 
    6. cout<<"Before swap a= "<<a<<" b= "<<b<<endl; 
    7. a=a+b; //a=15 (5+10) 
    8. b=a-b; //b=5 (15-10) 
    9. a=a-b; //a=10 (15-5) 
    10. cout<<"After swap a= "<<a<<" b= "<<b<<endl; 
    11. return 0; 
    12.} 
    Output:
    Before swap a= 5 b= 10 
    After swap a= 10 b= 5
    Matrix multiplication in C++
    We can add, subtract, multiply and divide 2 matrices. To do so, we are taking input from 
    the user for row number, column number, first matrix elements and second matrix 
    elements. Then we are performing multiplication on the matrices entered by the user.
    In matrix multiplication first matrix one row element is multiplied by second matrix all 
    column elements.
    Let's try to understand the matrix multiplication of 3*3 and 3*3 matrices by the figure 
    given below:Let's see the program of matrix multiplication in C++.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int a[10][10],b[10][10],mul[10][10],r,c,i,j,k; 
    6. cout<<"enter the number of row="; 
    7. cin>>r; 
    8. cout<<"enter the number of column="; 
    9. cin>>c;

    C++ Program to convert Decimal to Binary
    We can convert any decimal number (base-10 (0 to 9)) into binary number (base-2 (0 or 
    1)) by C++ program.
    Decimal Number
    Decimal number is a base 10 number because it ranges from 0 to 9, there are total 10 digits 
    between 0 to 9. Any combination of digits is decimal number such as 223, 585, 192, 0, 7 
    etc.
    Binary Number
    Binary number is a base 2 number because it is either 0 or 1. Any combination of 0 and 1 is 
    binary number such as 1001, 101, 11111, 101010 etc.
    Let's see the some binary numbers for the decimal number.
    Decimal Binary
    1 0
    2 10
    3 11
    4 100
    5 101
    6 110
    7 111
    8 1000
    9 100110 1010
    Decimal to Binary Conversion Algorithm
    Step 1: Divide the number by 2 through % (modulus operator) and store the remainder in 
    array
    Step 2: Divide the number by 2 through / (division operator)
    Step 3: Repeat the step 2 until the number is greater than zero
    Let's see the C++ example to convert decimal to binary.
    1. #include <iostream> 
    2. using namespace std; 
    3. int main() 
    4. { 
    5. int a[10], n, i;

    15.{ 
    16. cout<<a[i]; 
    17.} 
    18.} 
    Output:
    Enter the number to convert: 9
    Binary of the given number= 1001
    C++ Program to Convert Number in CharactersIn C++ language, we can easily convert number in characters by the help of loop and 
    switch case. In this program, we are taking input from the user and iterating this number 
    until it is 0. While iteration, we are dividing it by 10 and the remainder is passed in switch 
    case to get the word for the number.
    Let's see the C++ program to convert number in characters.

    A list of top frequently asked C++ interview questions and answers are given below.
    1) What is C++?
    C++ is an object oriented programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is 
    released in 1985.
    2) What are the advantages of C++?
    C++ doesn't only maintains all aspects from C language, it also simplify memory 
    management and add several features like:
    o Includes a new datatype known as a class.
    o Allows object oriented programming.
    3) What is the difference between C and C++?
    No. C C++
    1) C follows the procedural 
    style programming.
    C++ is multi-paradigm. It supports 
    both procedural and object 
    oriented.2) Data is less secured in C. In C++, you can use modifiers for 
    class members to make it 
    inaccessible for outside users.
    3) C follows the top-down 
    approach.
    C++ follows the bottom-up 
    approach.
    4) C does not support function 
    overloading.
    C++ supports function overloading.
    5) In C, you can't use functions 
    in structure.
    In C++, you can use functions in 
    structure.
    6) C does not support reference 
    variables.
    C++ supports reference variables.
    6) In C, scanf() and printf() are 
    mainly used for 
    input/output.
    C++ mainly uses stream cin and 
    cout to perform input and output 
    operations.
    4) What is the difference between reference and pointer?
    No. Reference Pointer
    1) References are less powerful 
    than pointers. Once a reference 
    is created, it can't refer to other 
    object later.
    Pointers provide the powerful 
    facilities than references.
    2) References are safer and easier 
    to use than pointers.
    Pointers are comparatively 
    difficult to use.5) What is a class?
    Class is a user-defined data type. Class defines the type definition of category of things. 
    It defines a datatype, but it does not define the data it just specifies the structure of 
    data.
    You can create N number of objects from a class.
    6) What is an object?
    Object is the instance of a class. A class provides a blueprint for objects. So you can 
    create an object from a class. The objects of a class are declared with the same sort of 
    declaration that we declare variables of basic types.
    7) What are the C++ access specifiers?
    The access specifiers are used to define how to functions and variables can be accessed 
    outside the class.
    There are three types of access specifiers:
    o Private: Functions and variables declared as private can be accessed only within 
    the same class and they cannot be accessed outside the class they are declared.
    o Public: Functions and variables declared under public can be accessed from 
    anywhere.
    o Protected: Functions and variables declared as protected cannot be accessed 
    outside the class except a child class. This specifier is generally used in 
    inheritance.
    8) What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?
    OOP is a methodology or paradigm that provides many concepts. The basic concepts of 
    Object Oriented Programming are given below:Classes and Objects: Classes are used to specify the structure of the data. They 
    define datatype. You can create any number of objects from a class. Objects are the 
    instances of classes.
    Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a mechanism which binds the data and associated 
    operations together and thus hide the data from outside world. Encapsulation is also 
    known as data hiding. In C++, It is achieved using the access specifiers i.e. public, 
    private and protected .
    Abstraction: Abstraction is used to hide the internal implementations and show only 
    the necessary details to the outer world. Data abstraction is implemented using 
    interfaces and abstract classes in C++.
    Some people confused about Encapsulation and abstraction. But they both are different.
    Inheritance: Inheritance is used to inherit the property of one class into another class. 
    It facilitates you to define one class in term of another class.
    9) What is the difference between array and a list?
    o Array is a collection of homogeneous elements while list is a collection of 
    heterogeneous elements.
    o Array memory allocation is static and continuous while List memory allocation is 
    dynamic and random.
    o In Array, users don't need to keep in track of next memory allocation while In list 
    user has to keep in track of next location where memory is allocated.
    10) What is the difference between new() and malloc()?
    o new() is a preprocessor while malloc() is a function.
    o There is no need to allocate the memory while using "new" but in malloc() you 
    have to use sizeof().
    o "new" initializes the new memory to 0 while malloc() gives random value in the 
    newly allotted memory location.11) What are the methods of exporting a function from a 
    DLL?
    There are two ways:
    o By using the DLL's type library.
    o Taking a reference to the function from the DLL instance.
    12) Define friend function.
    Friend function acts as friend of the class. It can access the private and protected 
    members of the class. The friend function is not a member of the class but it must be 
    listed in the class definition.
    13) What is virtual function?
    A virtual function is used to replace the implementation provided by the base class. The 
    replacement is always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived 
    class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a derived pointer.
    14) When should we use multiple inheritance?
    You can answer this question in three manners:
     Never
     Rarely
     If you find that the problem domain cannot be accurately modeled any other way.
    15) What is the destructor?
    Destructor is used to delete any extra resources allocated by the object.16) What is an overflow error?
    It is a type of arithmetical error. It is happen when the result of an arithmetical 
    operation been greater than the actual space provided by the system.
    17) What is overloading?
    C++ facilitates you to specify more than one definition for a function name or an 
    operator in the same scope. It is called function overloading and operator overloading 
    respectively.
    18) What is function overriding?
    If you inherit a class into a derived class and provide a definition for one of the base 
    class's function again inside the derived class, then this function is called overridden 
    function and this mechanism is known as function overriding.
    19) What is virtual inheritance?
    Virtual inheritance facilitates you to create only one copy of each object even if the 
    object appears more than one in the hierarchy.
    20) What is constructor?
    Constructor is a special method that initializes object. It name must be same as class 
    name.21) What is the purpose of " delete" operator?
    The " delete" operator is used to release the dynamic memory created by " new" 
    operator.
    22) Explain this pointer?
    This pointer holds the address of current object.
    23) What does Scope Resolution operator?
    A scope resolution operator(::) is used to define the member function outside the class.
    24) What is the difference between delete and delete[]?
    Delete [] is used to release the array of allocated memory which was allocated using 
    new[] whereas delete is used to release one chunk of memory which was allocated 
    using new.
    25) Define the private, protected and public in C++?
    Private: The data members and functions cannot be accessed from outside the class.
    Protected: The data members and functions are accessible to derived class only.
    Public: The data members and functions can be accessed from outside the class.
